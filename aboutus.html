                <p class="about">
                    Bonnie came up with the idea for this app after spending many hours pouring over a paper map,
                    tracing out routes for runs, wondering why something like Boundless didn't already exist.

                <p class="about">
                    Colin Andrew Coutts CBE is an English actor who has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award,
                    two BAFTA Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at
                    the Venice Film Festival.
                    <br><br>
                    Special thanks to my team for teaching this old actor a few new tricks.

                <h4>Payton</h4>
                <p class="about">
                    Although Payton has a strong aversion to running, he loves hiking and walking is okay too, so this app has been right up his alley... or trail. He hasn't actually been to Forest Park yet, so this is going to legitimately come in handy soon. Thanks to my teammates for all the hard work and laughs over the last few days!<br><br>The Runs are dead, long live The Runs.

                <h4>Laura</h4>
                <p class="about">
                    Laura likes long walks through the woods and over the hills to grandmotherâ€™s house. Her main hope is to use this app to eliminate the final excuse to starting her New Year resolution... and to avoid getting lost in the woods...again. 
                    <br><br>
                    A special thanks to my teammates Bonnie, Colin and Payton for putting up with me and making this
                    sick app!
